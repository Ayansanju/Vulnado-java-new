# Documentation: `VulnadoApplication.java`

## Overview
The `VulnadoApplication` class serves as the entry point for a Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@ServletComponentScan`, enabling Spring Boot's auto-configuration and scanning for servlet components. The application also includes a call to a custom `Postgres.setup()` method, which likely initializes database-related configurations.

## Class: `VulnadoApplication`

### Purpose
This class is the main entry point for the application. It initializes the Spring Boot framework and performs any necessary setup for the application, including database configuration.

### Annotations
| Annotation              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@SpringBootApplication`| Combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. It enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration and component scanning. |
| `@ServletComponentScan` | Enables scanning for servlet components, such as filters and listeners, within the application. |

### Methods

#### `public static void main(String[] args)`
- **Purpose**: The main method starts the Spring Boot application and performs any necessary setup before the application runs.
- **Logic**:
  1. Calls `Postgres.setup()` to initialize database-related configurations.
  2. Invokes `SpringApplication.run()` to bootstrap the Spring Boot application.

---

## Insights

1. **Database Initialization**: The `Postgres.setup()` method is called before the application starts. This indicates that the application relies on a PostgreSQL database, and the setup method likely handles connection pooling, schema initialization, or other database-related configurations.

2. **Servlet Component Scanning**: The use of `@ServletComponentScan` suggests that the application may include custom servlets, filters, or listeners. These components are automatically detected and registered by Spring Boot.

3. **Spring Boot Framework**: The class leverages Spring Boot's auto-configuration capabilities, simplifying the setup and configuration of the application.

4. **Modular Design**: The separation of database setup into a dedicated `Postgres.setup()` method promotes modularity and maintainability.
